> Hello Everyone!

I have created this custom program in 2026 to support our MHE manager with his work-routine,
to help him with process of training individuals on MHE machinery to have all records and bookings
in one place

Be free of using this program.
If any question, don't you worry of contacting me

- Main purpose of this customised program is to keep
	records and track on training schedules for individual person.

- Calendar is capable to book - recall - update bookings.

- We can select year/month/start day and after pressing the "update" button, calendar will show
	booked items just for selected year/month

!!! Be aware, that database is row-ID num. sensitive, therefore is nor recommended to delete lines manually
	as program and its items will behave unpredictable in the calendar
	The same with calendar itself. Do not create/delete columns or rows !!!

- For each day, there is only one individual item, that can store 3x names, under which
	we can capture progress for the individual person.

- To avoid hidden-overlapped items, the program will inform you that booking slot is already occupied

- Additional "Delete" button, actually do not delete the booking, but clear date information, so it becomes 
	hidden in the database
